# New ICT Models Backtest Report

Event-study only. No profitability claim.

## Migration Summary
- Old Entry Model 1/2/3 are archived in `strategies/legacy/`.
- Old models are disabled by default.
- New registry default models are `turtle_soup`, `silver_bullet`, `ifvg_retest`.

## Backtest Config
- data_dir: data/history_2025-05-01_2025-06-30
- models: silver_bullet
- symbols: BTCUSDT
- timeframes: 15m
- same_bar_policy: conservative
- context_mode: aligned_only
- forward_bars: 20
- event-study alignment: `setup_timestamp`; R outcomes are measured from `entry_time` when it differs.
